# Generating Keywords for Google Ads : Furniture Store

## Project Description

Project Description
You work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. You are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With your Python skills, you will efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.

## The brief: 

  The client is generally a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. We will need to focus on such keywords. We will also need to move away from luxury keywords and topics, as we are targeting price-sensitive customers. Because we are going to be tight on budget, it would be good to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match.
